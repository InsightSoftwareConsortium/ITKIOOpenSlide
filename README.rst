This is an InsightToolkit (ITK) ExternalModule to provide an ImageIO for the
OpenSlide library supported file formats.  These are generally TIFF-based
microscopy formats.

To use this module, clone it into the Modules/External directory in the ITK
source tree.

Note that the OpenSlide library (http://openslide.org) must be available.

*Note:*  This module is currently a work in progress.
